<a id="drawing-with-distance" class="anchor" href="#drawing-with-distance" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Drawing with Distance</h3>

<p>How do you teach a computer to draw on it's own? One of the easiest ways to do this is to teach the computer some metric of distance and then to colour the pixels on the page based on the distance of each pixel to a particular point. Below I'm going to introduce the basics using your bog standard <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Distance.html">linear distance between points</a>. If you want to use the same program to represent some complicated data or simply to draw more subtle images then you may want to investigate what happens if you use other metrics of distance i.e. if you alter what you <em>mean</em> by distance.</p>

<p>The simplest case is to take a single point at the centre of your page (0,0) and calculate every pixel's distance to that point, colouring in the page based on the distance. Doing this might give you an image that looks something like this</p>

<p><img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7373621/8260097/5d88651c-16b9-11e5-94d4-c197f7fab784.jpg" alt="distance to point"></p>

<p>Changing the colour map used to fill in the pixels and additionally take the <em>sin()</em> of the distance as the colour indicator you might get an image which looks something like</p>

<h3>
<a id="lines-or-curves" class="anchor" href="#lines-or-curves" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Lines or Curves</h3>

<p>Suppose that instead of a point you calculate the minimum <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Point-LineDistance2-Dimensional.html">perpendicular distance of each point to a line</a>. This can be done using the same function <a href="https://github.com/rupertsmall/distance-heat-maps/blob/master/get_min_perp.m">get_min_perp.m</a> as the first example above. If your line is a <em>sin()</em> curve, say, then you might generate an image which looks something like this</p>

<p><img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7373621/8260102/5d8ae7ce-16b9-11e5-9b94-08179a7aa8c0.jpg" alt="distance to sin( ) curve"></p>

<p>As before if you change the colour map used to fill in the colour of each pixels and take the <em>lognormal</em> of the distance instead (or any other function for that matter) you might get something like</p>

<p><img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7373621/8260100/5d8ace6a-16b9-11e5-8322-7423a67817aa.jpg" alt="distance to sin( ) with lognormal"></p>

<h3>
<a id="random-drawing" class="anchor" href="#random-drawing" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Random Drawing</h3>

<p>What happens if your curve is random? Now the <a href="https://github.com/rupertsmall/distance-heat-maps/blob/master/get_min_perp.m">get_min_perp.m</a> function behaves exactly as before, except that its now calculating the perpendicular distance to a randomly generated curve. Drawing the result <em>will not</em> look like this for you, because the result will change every time you run the program (it's random after all!). The output on my computer looked like this</p>

<p><img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7373621/8260099/5d8ab0a6-16b9-11e5-8ed1-c8708b4962af.jpg" alt="distance to random curve"></p>

<p>and changing the colour map and taking the <em>lognormal</em> of the distance gave me this</p>
